# CLI Calc

A very naive and simple CLI calculator.
The interpreter currently supports
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Division (/)
- Multiplication (*)
- Integer operands
- Integer only math (e.g. 5/2 = 2)
- Negation of operands via ! (e.g. !1*3 = -3)

## Running the code
You will need dotnet SDK 6.0 or later installed.
Clone this repository and then run the following commands.
